The French House Soho The interior of the French House looks more like a Parisian backstreet bar, than a traditional London pub - and it remains a favourite of artists, writers, actors and photographers, George Dailey describes the inside as "a little tired, faintly bohemian - but with unmistakeable Gallic charm".
The Ship Tavern  Holborn Although rebuilt in the 1920s, there has probably been a pub on the site of The Ship since the mid-16th Century - and in its early incarnation it was known as a haven for persecuted Catholics.
