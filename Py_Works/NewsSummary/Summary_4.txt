Bradford Coroner's Court heard Mr Yaqub had been shot through the windscreen of an Audi car after a "hard stop" on the motorway slip road.
Four unmarked police cars were involved in the incident with one, a Mercedes, cutting across the front of the Audi, coroner's officer Chris Dalby told the hearing.
