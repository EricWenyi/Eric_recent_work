 Golden Globe nominated actor Casey Affleck says that he "got lucky" to get his part in drama Manchester by the Sea - after replacing his friend Matt Damon at the last minute.
"The truth is there's so much media out there, so much TV, and there's a lot of material written for comedies and dramas, but there are very few things that have been brewing for years in the way Kenny writes things," the actor claims.
