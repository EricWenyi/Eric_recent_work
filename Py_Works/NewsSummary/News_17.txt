 6 January 2017 Last updated at 09:49 GMT  Oliver Lang, from Norfolk, spent two months longer than necessary in a psychiatric unit. The 27-year-old, who has Asperger's syndrome, was initially detained under the Mental Health Act. But weeks after he was told he could leave, he remained in the unit while two separate mental trusts argued over who should pay for his care.
