A gunman opened fire in Reina nightclub at about 01:30 local time (22:30 GMT), as revellers marked the new year. Suleyman Soylu said efforts were continuing to find the attacker, who was believed to have acted alone.  At least 69 people were being treated in hospital, the minister added. Four were said to be in a serious condition.  "A manhunt for the terrorist is under way. Police have launched operations. We hope the attacker will be captured soon," he said.  Only 21 of the victims had been identified, he said. Fifteen or 16 were foreigners, he said, and at least three of the Turkish victims may have been employees at the club.  "This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery,'' he said. Early media reports suggested the attacker may have been wearing a Santa Claus outfit, but newly-obtained CCTV footage shows the suspected attacker in a black coat outside the club.  The minister said that the assailant was believed to have left the club wearing "different clothing", but did not elaborate. Reina nightclub, in the the Ortakoy area of Istanbul, is an upscale venue on the banks of Bosphorus. Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said the attacker killed a policeman and a civilian outside the club before entering and opening fire.  "Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,'' the Associated Press news agency quoted Sinem Uyanik, who was inside the club, as saying.  "I had to lift several bodies from (on) top of me before I could get out. It was frightening.'' There were reportedly as many as 700 people in the nightclub at the time of the attack, some of whom jumped into the water to escape.  The Turkish authorities have imposed a media blackout on coverage of the attack, citing security and public order concerns, but it does not extend to official statements.  Some media reports spoke of more than one attacker and Dogan news agency reported that some witnesses claimed the attackers were "speaking Arabic", but there is no confirmation of this.  Despite there being no official statement about who might be behind this brutal attack, the finger of blame is being pointed at the so-called Islamic State.  In the last two years of attacks in Turkey, Kurdish militants have mostly targeted military forces and police, while IS is known to target civilians.  IS leaders have threatened Turkey and called on their followers to carry out attacks inside the country.  Turkey began a ground operation against IS as well as Kurdish groups inside Syria four months ago.  US President Barack Obama, who is on holiday in Hawaii, was among the first international leaders to make a statement after being briefed by his team. "The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted," White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement. Istanbul was already on high alert with some 17,000 police officers on duty in the city, following a string of terror attacks in recent months. Many were carried out by so-called Islamic State (IS) or Kurdish militants. Less than a fortnight ago, Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov was shot dead by off-duty Turkish policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas as he gave a speech in the capital Ankara. After the shooting, the killer shouted the murder was in revenge for Russian involvement in the conflict in the Syrian city of Aleppo. 10 December: Twin bomb attack outside a football stadium in Istanbul kills 44 people, Kurdish militant group claims responsibility 20 August: Bomb attack on wedding party in Gaziantep kills at least 30 people, IS suspected 30 July: 35 Kurdish fighters try to storm a military base and are killed by the Turkish army 28 June: A gun and bomb attack on Ataturk airport in Istanbul kills 41 people, in an attack blamed on IS militants 13 March: 37 people are killed by Kurdish militants in a suicide car bombing in Ankara 17 February: 28 people die in an attack on a military convoy in Ankara A gunman is on the run after at least 39 people were killed in an attack on an Istanbul nightclub.

Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link The manhunt continues for a gunman who killed 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub as Turkey marked the start of the new year. The unknown assailant opened fire at Reina nightclub early on Sunday, before managing to flee amid the chaos. The motive for the attack is not clear, but suspicion has fallen on the Islamic State group, already linked to at least two terror attacks in Turkey last year. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said such groups tried "to create chaos".  "They are trying to... demoralise our people and destabilise our country," he added.  The banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has distanced itself from the killings, with the PKK's Murat Karayilan quoted as saying it would "never target innocent civilians". Earlier, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu confirmed a "manhunt for the terrorist is under way. Police have launched operations. We hope the attacker will be captured soon." But as the search continued, the first funerals of those killed at the nightclub were held. More than half of those killed in the attack - which lasted seven minutes - were foreign, according to the state run Anadolu Agency. Among them were citizens from Israel, Russia, France, Tunisia, Lebanon, India, Belgium, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Details continue to emerge about those killed. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has confirmed a Canadian had died in the attack, while a US businessman named as William Jacob Raak, 35, from Delaware was reported to be among the injured. The club, which sits on the banks of the Bosphorus, is one of Istanbul's most upmarket venues - popular with foreigners and often frequented by singers and sports stars. However, among the first to die was a security guard, identified as Fatih Cakmak, who had been standing at the door.  His brother said he narrowly escaped a double bombing three weeks ago, having been on duty  when Kurdish militants launched an attack near a football stadium, killing at least 44 people, mostly police.  At least 69 people are being treated in hospital, officials said, with three in a serious condition.
