 Family and friends of actresses Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher have paid their respects to the mother and daughter at a private memorial service.
Meryl Streep, who starred in the big screen adaptation of Postcards from the Edge, carried a bunch of white roses as she walked up to Fisher's home in the Hollywood Hills.
